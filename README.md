# RaffleNinja: The Twitch Giveaway/Raffle Entry Bot

A dictionary attack I created, that will take the [number of Twitch accounts/windows open], [Twitch chat delay (in seconds)] and [raffle prefix keyword if any (eg: !raffle / !join)] as the input (either in the form of an integrated random number generator range, or supplying a dictionary/list file) and then enter the giveaway/raffle automatically for each account/window. This project was created in Python.

**Dependencies to "pip install" before being able to run the Python files:**

**pynput** (for simulating key presses)

**colorama** (for colors)

**termcolor** (for colors)
