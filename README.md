A dictionary attack implementation, that takes the following as input:

- Number of active Twitch accounts/windows
- Current Twitch chat delay (in seconds)
- Raffle prefix keyword if any (eg: !raffle / !join)
- Raffle expression (either a specified range of numbers, or via a supplied custom dictionary/list file)

This project was created in Python, for personal use.
